mkdir_rule=Group all 'mkdir' commands into single layer
label_not_present_rule=Use LABEL Command to organize images by project, recording license info, to aid in automation
multiple_labels_rule=If docker version < 1.10: Merge multiple LABEL commands to single LABEL command. If docker version >=1.10: ignore the recommendation, but as good practice merge LABEL to single command
sudo_rule=Avoid installing (or) using 'sudo' as it has unpredictable TTY and signal-forwarding behaviour, use 'gosu' (https://github.com/tianon/gosu) 
add_rule=COPY is preferred. As copy does the basic copy which is transparent than ADD
base_image_rule=Tag the version of the image explicitly, never rely on 'latest' as tag
dist_rule=Dist files like .tar.gz/.whl should be installed directly from the internal private repo's to decrease size of docker image
